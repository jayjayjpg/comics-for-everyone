Two were hospitalized for more than two weeks.[9] Some had seizures when parts of the scene were rebroadcast during news reports on the seizures.[8] Only a small fraction of the 685 children treated were diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy.[10] The incident was referred to as \"Pokémon Shock\" (ポケモンショック Pokémon Shokku) by the Japanese press.\n\nLater studies showed that 5–10% of the viewers had mild symptoms that did not need hospital treatment.[7] Twelve thousand children who were not sent to hospital reported mild symptoms of illness; however, their symptoms more closely resembled mass hysteria than a grand mal seizure.[5][12] A study following 103 patients over three years after the event found that most had no further seizures.[13] Scientists believe that the flashing lights triggered photosensitive seizures in which visual stimuli such as flashing lights can cause altered consciousness.[clarification needed] Although approximately 1 in 4,000 people are susceptible to these types of seizures, the number of people affected by the Pokémon episode was unprecedented.[1][9]\n"}}}
