  Manual Testing using Screen Readers is Obligatory
  ...and actually see for yourself what the experience is like. Reassure yourself that you can navigate the page. Which elements do you have trouble finding on your first exploration of the page? Which elements have disappeared from the page entirely and don't seem to be available to your screen reader at all? Staying in that space, sharing the experience of a screen reader user again and again is the only way to further our knowledge about accessibility, nourish empathy for all of our audience and not only the bits of our audience that are just as abled as us. It can show us to which extent we broke the web in the first place and guide us into the right direction for fixing it.

  This is bigger than just comics.
